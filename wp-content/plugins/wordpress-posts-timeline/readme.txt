Output your WordPress posts or custom post types as a timeline with a few options.

== Description ==

The WordPress Posts Timeline Plugin uses only css to create a vertical timeline for a post category or custom taxonomy. The CSS is very flexible so it should look good in small or large sizes. 

It will pull uncategorized posts by default.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `wordpress-posts-timeline.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use shortcode [wp-timeline] in page or template to display timeline.
4. See 'other notes' for syntax options

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the date format? =

The date is pulled from your posts published date. If you need to backdate, you can change it there. There are currently four date options on the settings page. If you wish to see more formats, please suggest one or edit the source yourself.
